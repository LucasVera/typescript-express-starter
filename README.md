# Inflw user api

---

This is the user service's API for Inflw.

### How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. In a terminal in the root of the project (bash preffered) run the command `npm install`
3. When it finishes installing the dependencies, run `npm start`
4. Alternatively, run the project in development mode (automatic reload) with `npm run dev`. Note this will fail the first time if you don't have a _dist_ folder yet. Simply stopping and running the command again should be enough
